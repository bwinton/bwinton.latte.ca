<div class="storyCategory">[/amy/houseandhome/bathroom]</div></div>
<div class="storyBody"><p>The first sign of trouble was the brown spot on the dining room ceiling.
   The dining room, as it turns out, is directly under the bathroom. I
   called Drainworks and they sent a guy&mdash;earring, shirt unbuttoned
   one button more than is conventional, small medallion&mdash;to have 
   a look. He determined 
   that the bathtub drain has a really slow leak, and he said the 
   same thing the last guy
   who came in to look at the last brown spot on the ceiling said: the
   pipes are old. They're as old as this house, and as Chris the sexy 
   plumber put it, they don't owe me anything. His thought was that the
   moment anyone puts a wrench to any part of the plumbing, all those
   eighty-year-old lead pipes will crumble and make a giant sloppy mess.
   He suggested we talk amongst ourselves and decide whether we want
   to do a patch job, just replace the pipes, or reno the whole damn bathroom.
</p>
<p>So we talked, and decided to get a quote on renovating the bathroom.
   We'll probably go ahead with the reno: the bathroom is really old,
   and we would all love a new bathroom with a new tub and some storage space.
   We're also planning to put in a cheap and tiny powder room in the basement,
   which will add a whole new dimension of happiness to our mornings.
</p>
<p>In the main bathroom we're replacing the ancient and not 
   particularly fancy clawfoot
   tub with a deep rectangular tub, and we'll replace the newish, expensive
   faux-Victorian faucet with something sleek, modern and easy to clean, with
   a handle up high so you don't have to bend over to adjust it, and a 
   handheld shower for rinsing little girls.
</p>
<p>We're keeping the toilet (we bought it when we moved in) and putting a
   wall between the tub and the toilet so you can't see the toilet when
   the bathroom door is open.
</p>
<p>We're going to move the
   <a href="http://www.latte.ca/pics/2006/0927/10-w-sink.jpg">old sink</a>
   down to the basement powder room, but when it's down there we'll replace the 
   newish, expensive faux-Victorian faucet with something 
   <a href="http://www.pricepfister.com/bath/Product/042-YP0C.aspx">cooler,
   easier to clean, but still kinda old-timey</a>. Upstairs we're going
   to put in a shallow, wide rectangular trough sink (no picture because I 
   can't find the kind of thing I want anywhere on the whole entire 
   Internet) with two 
   <a href="http://www.pricepfister.com/bath/Product/042-VGCC.aspx">faucets</a>.
   We're also going to have a proper vanity and a giant mirror, and
   whatever storage our designer can cram in.
</p>
<p>The floor and walls will be white ceramic tile, and we'll put radiant
   heat under the floor for wintertime post-shower happy toes.
</p>
<p>It's all going to be rather awesome (and probably awesomely expensive)
   and I'm quite excited. It will be nice to have at least one room in the
   house be slick and modern and cool.
</p>
<p>And I'll take lots of pictures.

   which is squeaky and loud and very enthusiastic. She also still

</p>
<p><strong>Cordelia:</strong> I can't decide if I should marry Charlie [her newborn cousin] or 
   Otis!<br />
   <strong>Me:</strong> I think you should marry Otis, because Charlie is already related to 
   you.<br />
   <strong>Cordelia:</strong> (Thinks about it.) But Otis doesn't like kissing, and kissing 
   is how you get married! 
</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> We only have three sea monkeys left. <br />
   <strong>Cordelia:</strong> But maybe two of them will get married and have babies! <br />
   <strong>Me:</strong> Do you need to get married to have babies?<br />
   <strong>Cordelia:</strong> No! (Thinks.) But you need to have a house!<br />
   <strong>Me:</strong> Why? <br />
   <strong>Cordelia:</strong> Because you have to do a naked hug to have babies! And if 
   you don't have a house everyone will see you do a bits-bits hug! 
   And bits are private!

<div class="storyTitle"><a class="taggedlink" name="threeDinners" href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/food/threeDinners.html"><b>A Tale of Three Dinners</b></a>
<div class="storyCategory">[/amy/food]</div></div>
<div class="storyBody"><p>I've been in a bit of a dinner rut lately, just cooking the same old
   things from memory night after night. Fortunately for the whole family,
   a few good recipes have fallen into my life lately. Here is the story of
   one dinner which led to another, and then another.
</p>
<p><strong>Dinner One: Asian-inspired Salmon Burgers</strong>
</p>
<p>This first recipe is from <em>Not Your Mother's Weeknight Cooking</em>
   by Beth Hensperger. The same author co-wrote <em>Not Your Mother's
   Slow Cooker Cookbook</em>, which is a frequently-used title on my
   cookbook shelf. The recipe is actually for Tuna Burgers, but of course 
   I messed with it. Here it is:
</p>
<p><strong>Wasabi Mayo</strong><br />
   3 green onions<br />
   one 1&frac12; inch chunk of fresh ginger<br />
   2 tsp soy sauce<br />
   2 tsp wasabi powder (I used European horseradish)<br />
   &frac12; cup mayonnaise<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Burgers</strong><br />
   3 green onions<br />
   one 1&frac12; inch chunk of fresh ginger<br />
   1 to 1&frac14; pounds tuna steaks (I used frozen salmon fillets because I am <em>so</em> cheap)<br />
   &frac14; cup cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks (OMG genius!!!)<br />
   2 tbsp soy sauce<br />
   2 tsp sesame oil<br />
   few grinds of freshly ground black pepper<br />
   4 buns (I actually ended up making eight burgers)<br />
   Butter lettuce leaves (hah - I found some old romaine at the back of the fridge)
</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>To make the mayo, blend all the ingredients together. I actually just
   chopped up the choppable stuff and mixed it together, and it was fine.
   Stick it all in a bowl and put it in the fridge while you make the burgers.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Chop up or food-process the green onions and ginger. Cut one quarter of
   the tuna into &frac14; inch cubes, and put the rest into the food processor 
   with the butter and the onions and ginger. Pulse to combine. 
   (Pause to marvel at the notion of mixing
   the butter <em>right into</em> the burger, and how it completely destroys any
   healthful properties of the fish. Oh, but it's going to be so good.) Put
   it all in a bowl and mix it with the diced fish and the soy sauce, sesame oil,
   and pepper. Shape into four equal-size patties. (As I said, I made eight
   little ones.)
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Preheat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Brown patties for three
   minutes on the first side and three to four on the other, until done.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Serve patties on buns with wasabi mayo and lettuce.
</p>

 </li>
</ol>
<p>Yum! We loved them.
</p>
<p><strong>Dinner Two: Couscous Salad</strong>
</p>
<p>My friend Tanya makes couscous salad all the time: couscous, parsley,
   diced red pepper, cucumber, celery, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, 
   olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. It's delicious and it keeps
   and travels well. Inspired by that, I used the leftover mayo to make
   my own version with couscous, soy beans, broccoli, and grated carrot.
   Another delicious hit.
</p>
<p><strong>Dinner Three: Mini Frittatas</strong>
</p>
<p>I've been getting ParentsCanada magazine lately&mdash;against my will; it
   comes with Cordelia's Chirp magazine&mdash;and while I'm still sitting on 
   the fence as to its usefulness as a parenting magazine, I do seem to clip 
   recipes out of every single issue that shows up in my mailbox. This month
   they had lunchbox recipes, and one of them was for little frittatas baked
   in muffin cups. Here's their recipe:
</p>
<p><strong>Mini Frittatas</strong>
</p>
<p>2 cups filling: cooked and chopped vegetables, torn fresh herbs, cooked 
   spaghetti, cooked crumbled sausage, ham or bacon, shredded roast chicken or 
   a combination of any of these<br />
   5-6 large eggs<br />
   &frac14; cup milk<br />
   &frac12; cup freshly grated Parmesan, cheddar, or other cheese<br />
   salt and pepper to taste
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F<br />
 </li>

 <li>
     Saut&eacute; raw veggies (if you're using them in your filling) so they
don't release liquid in the frittatas and make them soggy<br />
 </li>

 <li>
     In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk and salt and pepper
     to taste. Add your fillings and if you like, some grated or crumbled
     cheese.<br />
 </li>

 <li>
     Divide the mixture among muffin tins that have been sprayed with nonstick 
     spray and sprinkle with grated cheese.<br />
 </li>

 <li>
     Bake for 15-20 minutes, until puffed and golden. (I actually baked
     it for ten or fifteen minutes longer&mdash;they wouldn't brown for me.) 
Serve warm for dinner 
or cool completely before packing up for lunch.<br />
 </li>
</ol>
<p>So I followed that recipe, using about 1&frac34; cups of the couscous
   salad from the day before as the filling, along with a can of tuna. They
   turned out awesome. The kids love them and I
   will totally be making this recipe for lunches.
</p>
<p>So there you go: tuna burgers &rarr; couscous salad &rarr; frittatas.
   Yum.

<div class="storyTitle"><a class="taggedlink" name="harbourfront" href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/daytoday/harbourfront.html"><b>Summer's Last Hurrah</b></a>
<div class="storyCategory">[/amy/daytoday]</div></div>
<div class="storyBody"><p>As summer draws to an end the girls and I are trying to squeeze the last of
   the fun out of the season. One of the last things on the list we came up with
   at the beginning of the year was to go to the Harbourfront, and that is
   what we did today.
</p>
<p>As usual we got off to a late start&mdash;between brushing hair and applying
   sunblock and looking for Playmobil horses and TTC tokens we didn't 
   leave the house until around ten. When we got down to the Harbourfront
   the first order of business (after saying goodbye to the crowds of people
   headed for the Ex) was to find money. Unfortunately RBC has a lock
   on Queen's Quay Terminal, so we wandered westward searching for a TD
   bank machine. On the way we saw: a camp "canoeing" (more being
   pushed about) on Natrel pond; Delphine's canoe camp (she showed us the
   giant canoe they all went out to Centre Island in); the 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Bridge,_Toronto">Amsterdam
   Bridge</a>; the 
   <a href="http://www.torontopedia.ca/Spadina_Wave_Deck">Spadina wave deck</a>; 
   and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTO_Park">HtO Park</a>. HtO Park is basically a giant
   sandbox with big metal umbrellas and Muskoka chairs&mdash;we couldn't
   decide if it was cool or lame, but Delphine liked the shower/footbath.
</p>
<p>At that point it was apparent that we wouldn't find a TD bank machine anywhere,
   so we headed back to Queen's Quay Terminal (via the 
   <a href="http://www.landezine.com/?p=993">Simcoe wave deck</a>) where I
   paid $1.50 for the privilege of taking money out of an RBC machine.
</p>
<p>Next on the itinerary was to buy tickets for a boat ride. We went with
   Mariposa Boat Cruises because they were the first kiosk we came to, and
   Cordelia rode for free. It was 12:00 so I bought tickets for the 1:30 ride
   to give us time to get lunch. After pondering Il Fornello and an 
   Irish pub, we decided to economize, and had chicken fingers, fish and
   chips, and a tuna sandwich at a grill-type place. Then back to Queen's Quay
   Terminal where we got an ice cream cone just in time to take it on the
   boat.
</p>
<p>We rode on the 
   <a href="http://www.mariposacruises.com/our-fleet-oriole.php">Oriole</a>
   (not quite as glamourous, in the harsh light of day, as they make it sound)
   and made ourselves at home on the lower deck, with only the bartender
   for company. I love the harbourfront boat tours&mdash;you get to go around
   the island lagoon, see the yachts, the bird sanctuary, the 
   <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/parks/island/lighthouse.htm">Gibraltar Point
   Lighthouse</a>, and of course the city from the other side. The
   girls loved it too, although Delphine had trouble keeping up with the
   tour guide's descriptions of buildings: "Between the two white buildings
   you'll see a tall gold building..." "Which one is it, Mama? I can't see it."
   By the time I described it again, of course, it was out of sight. Cordelia
   probably just couldn't make sense of it at all and was enjoying the ride
   on her own terms. It's good to be four.
</p>
<p>A few things bothered me about the information given out in the
   tour. They talked about the 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto-Dominion_Centre">TD Centre</a> 
   but they didn't mention it
   was designed by Mies van der Rohe; they talked about 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Canadian_Place">First Canadian
   Place</a> but they didn't mention it by name (they called it the Bank of 
   Montreal building) and they didn't say why it has scaffolding at the top; they
   called Canada geese "Canadian geese" which is a neologism which drives
   me crazy; and finally (is that all?!) they said the CN in CN Tower stands
   for "Canada's National". Which is just stupid, although according to
   this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower">Wikipedia page</a> not
   entirely wrong.
</p>
<p>After the tour we visited what Delphine calls the Lemming Ball, for reasons
   I will leave to her to explain when she has a blog. It's a giant, hollow
   cement sphere which you can walk into through a wooden ramp. It is
   surprisingly underdocumented on the Internet (or else I am searching wrong)
   and you'd have to see it to really understand. The girls thought it was
   really cool; I was too busy Twittering about two old people sitting on
   a nearby bench making out like teenagers.
</p>
<p>Next we charged over to Yonge Street (in the hot hot sun) in search 
   of the Royal York Hotel. Those
   of you who are smarter than me will be saying, "Hey, isn't the Royal
   York on Bay Street?" As it turns out, it is, so we charged over to
   Yonge Street, walked under the Gardiner (boo, hiss) and then (once
   I realized my mistake) charged
   back west on Front Street until we finally reached the elegantly
   air conditioned Royal York. I thought the girls would be impressed
   by the shiny old-school, dimly lit, brass-and-Persian-carpets luxury
   of it, and so they were. They also immediately quieted down and behaved
   like princesses as soon as we got inside; to the manner born, they are.
</p>
<p>We found a fancy hotel restroom and took our time freshening up, and 
   then I impulsively suggested that we go to 
   <a href="http://www.epicrestaurant.ca/">Epic</a> for drinks. The
   maitre d' was busy on the phone helping someone plan his (or her) proposal
   dinner, so we found ourselves a table and ordered lemonade for Cordelia,
   a Shirley Temple for Delphine and iced tea for me. (That's "drinks" when
   you travel with a four-year-old and a seven-year-old.) The drinks came with
   an elegant silver bowl of not-entirely-elegant snack mix: beer nuts, 
   wasabi peas, cheese crackers, and sesame chips. It was delightfully
   refreshing, all the more so because for some reason they only charged
   us for my drink. I guess it pays to be really cute.
</p>
<p>On the way home we intersected with about a million cranky TDSB teachers
   TTCing home from 
   <a href="http://www.tdsb.on.ca/microsites/believe_it//about.asp">Spence-a-palooza</a> with their unwanted green tote bags. It's interesting to see how
   many teachers live in our neighbourhood&mdash;there were at least four
   on our bus alone.
</p>
<p>(I may have inadvertently insulted our French/gym teacher within his
   earshot. I was talking to an acquaintance, also a teacher, and saying I
   wished we had a proper gym teacher at our school; the kids either get
   a non-gym teacher who happens to be free at the right time, or they
   get M. Landry who is half gym, half French, but his heart is really in 
   the French classroom. However, what I actually said
   was "M. Landry is just an angry French teacher", which is, I believe,
   an accurate characterization. As I said it a guy sitting nearby kind
   of smirked, and when he got off the bus at our stop he was talking
   to his friend in a French accent. So, oops, maybe.)
</p>
<p>Then we were home and I sent the children off to play at a neighbour's
   house while I took a few minutes to relax. It was a great day&mdash;I
   love exploring the city with my kids, they are such good company. (Even
   when they pick and snipe at each other all day as they have been lately.)
</p>
<p>Tomorrow they're going for back-to-school haircuts and then we'll hit
   the library and the park, if it isn't raining.

<div class="storyBody"><p>As someone who works on an email client, I’m interested in making
   my communications more secure.  So, with the assistance of
   <a href="http://perso.hirlimann.net/~ludo/blog/">Ludovic</a> and
   <a href="http://gozer.ectoplasm.org/blog/">Gozer</a>, I got a client certificate that
   would allow me to sign and encrypt my messages.  (Check out the envelope
   and lock in the image below.)
</p>
<p><img src="/images/blake/SignedAndEncrypted.png" title="Signed and Encrypted" alt="An outgoing message, with an envelope and a
lock"/>
</p>
<p>Most of the time, I’ll probably just sign my messages – after all, that’s
   what I’ve set it up to do by default – but it’s nice to know that if
   there’s something I need to encrypt, that option is now available to me.

<p><strong><em>Science, Sense and Nonsense</em></strong> <strong>by Joe Schwarcz</strong> is a collection of
   commentaries on chemistry in everyday life, with a side of fraud-spotting
   advice. The book covers antioxidants, trans fats, historical alternatives 
   to rubber, and a wealth of other topics serious and amusing.
</p>
<p><strong><em>The Devil's Arithmetic</em></strong> <strong>by Jane Yolen</strong> is a young adult book
   about a modern girl who, bored with her family Seder, is transported back
   in time to 1941 Poland. I guess maybe the only thing worse than being a
   Jew in Poland in 1941 is being a Jew in Poland in 1941 who knows the future.
   She and her entire village are sent to a concentration camp where they
   fight to survive and to retain their humanity. This book has won a heap
   of awards (and I just found out it was made into a movie with Kirsten
   Dunst and Brittany Murphy) and it is a wonderful story about the importance
   of remembering.
</p>
<p>I read <strong><em>The Root Cellar</em></strong> <strong>by Janet Lunn</strong> out loud to Delphine.
   It's another time travel book, about a girl who is left alone when
   her grandmother dies. She is packed off to live with relatives in rural
   Ontario and is lonely and miserable until she discovers that the 
   root cellar takes her back in time to the 1860s, where she makes friends
   and feels more at home than in the present. Her twin challenges are to
   track down a friend who doesn't return from the American civil war (in
   the past) and to find a place for herself in her new family (in the
   present). I loved this book when
   I was a child, and Delphine liked it this time around, as did I.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Shakespeare: The World as a Stage</em></strong> <strong>by Bill Bryson</strong> is a
   short biography of Shakespeare&mdash;short because we don't really know
   much about the playwright. In addition to what little we do know, 
   Bryson covers disproved (or unlikely)
   theories and myths. As always, readable and informative.
</p>
<p><strong><em>The History of Love</em></strong> <strong>by Nicole Krauss</strong> was a book club book.
   It's about old man who feels like he is disappearing; his long-lost
   son, a famous novelist; a teenage girl named Alma whose mother is
   translating a book which turns out was written by... well, you'll have
   to read it yourself. It's one of those books where the stories go
   along in parallel and you have to try and figure out how they're connected
   before the end when the author ties everything together with a big
   bow. It was a lovely book; I enjoyed reading it, although in book
   club we decided you have to read it in big chunks or you'll get 
   too confused.
</p>
<p><strong><em>The Unfinished Angel</em></strong> <strong>by Sharon Creech</strong> is a... young adult?
   Middle grade? I never know&mdash;although I'll have to figure it out pretty
   soon because I'm helping a friend with her middle-grade novel this fall&mdash;
   Anyway, it's a book about an angel whose quiet life in a tower is 
   interrupted by the arrival of a girl who changes everything in the
   village. The book is written in the childlike voice of the angel, which
   sounds a little cringe-y, but Sharon Creech is a phenomenal writer and
   she makes it work. This is only a short book and it goes quickly, but 
   it's well worth reading.

<div class="storyBody"><p>OMG, look at this! I was going to write a book blog post and
   here I find this half-finished book blog post. So I'm just going to
   finish this up and post it, and then I will work on blogging the eighteen
   thousand books I've read since I wrote this.
</p>
<hr />

<p><strong><em>Twelve Books That Changed the World</em></strong> <strong>by Melvyn Bragg</strong> is
   a book that doesn't need much introduction. I believe it's a
   tie-in book to a TV series, the kind of TV series that could
   only be produced in England. The books range from the
   St James Bible to Mary Woolstonecraft's <em>A Vindication of the 
Rights of Woman</em> and, curiously, <em>Rules of Association
Football</em>. Each book is given its place in history, and as
   such this book is an excellent cheat sheet for someone whose
   education in history is lacking.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Further Under the Duvet</em></strong> <strong>by Marian Keyes</strong> was recommended
   to me by someone on Twitter (I think it was 
   <a href="http://www.twitter.com/flossieteacake">FlossieTeacake</a>)
   after a discussion of villa-itis, or the fear that you are going
   to run out of bread while staying at a French villa. The book
   is a collection of essays and short stories. Keyes is an Irish
   writer with the most extraordinary Cinderalla story of going
   from abject alcoholism to fame and riches as a writer. The story
   is told in the book, along with essays on the joy of writing
   a makeup column (free samples!), air-guitar championships, shopping
   and plenty of chocolate. Funny and sweet.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Positive Discipline</em></strong> <strong>by Dr. Jane Nelsen</strong> is yet
   another positive/democratic/whatever parenting book. I don't know
   why I keep reading them, since I more-or-less know what I'm doing
   by now, but it's good to be reminded, and I do pick up different
   ideas from the various books. This particular book reminded me
   of the importance of family meetings, and reassured me that some
   problems (namely chores) will have to be revisited at regular
   intervals but are still worth handling democratically. I wouldn't
   call this my favourite democratic parenting book&mdash;it's just
   not funny enough. But it's worth a look if you need a refresher
   (or an introduction to positive parenting) or if you want a new
   angle.
</p>
<p><strong><em>The Gargoyle</em></strong> <strong>by Andrew Davidson</strong> is our first book club book
   of the year, and already this year's book club selection is looking better
   than last year's. <em>The Gargoyle</em> is about a man who gets terribly
   burned in a car crash, then meets a mysterious woman with a
   bizarre past while he's recovering. It's about love and redemption
   and all that good stuff, with a big dose of history. It's beautifully
   written and I didn't want it to end.
</p>
<p><strong><em>The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</em></strong> <strong>by Atul Gawande</strong>.
   I have long been a fan of the checklist. I like to-do lists to keep
   my days focused, I like lists of things to take places, I like
   to record our daily routines in list form so nothing is forgotten.
   This book is the validation for my checklist habit: Gawande writes
   about how checklists can improve the outcome of extremely complex
   projects, such as construction projects, and surgeries. Checklists
   are already in use in construction and aviation, and the book centres
   on Gawande and his team's attempt to create a checklist to reduce
   the number of fatalities as a result of surgeries. It's not a smooth
   path, but along the way we learn the kinds of checklists (DO-CONFIRM
   and READ-DO), what makes a good checklist (not too much information,
   easy to read), what makes a bad checklist (too long), and the
   mind-boggling difference that a checklist can make in a process that
   everyone involved feels is already going pretty well. (Gawande
   uses his own checklist, and at first he thought it wouldn't make
   much difference to <em>his</em> outcomes. As it turns out, not a week
   goes by that the checklist doesn't catch something he would have
   missed, and it has even saved at least one life on his watch).
</p>
<p>As usual, Gawande is engaging and convincing. This was a great
   read as well as a confirmation (and refinement) of my love for
   checklists.

<div class="storyBody"><p>Blake and I went for a bike ride today while the girls were out swimming
   with Baba and Zaida. I didn't really want to go, but Blake does so love
   to ride his bike, and I don't mind biking. So off we went, and went up
   some steepish hills and down a slightly scary one, found some nice nature
   to bring Delphine to, and lost contact with my butt. And that was, as
   they say, all well and good, but the interesting thing happened later.
</p>
<p>I felt great.
</p>
<p>My back didn't hurt, my foot didn't hurt (I've had plantar fasciitis for,
   like, months), and I had enough energy to run up and down the sidewalk
   flying a kite with Cordelia. I didn't realize how bad I'd been feeling lately
   until I stopped feeling bad, and clearly part of the problem is the
   utter lack of aerobic exercise I've been doing lately. I'm not exactly
   sure what I'm going to do about that...
</p>
<hr />

<p>Cordelia and I fought today. Not the screamy angry kind of fighting,
   but silly punching kicking fighting. She was hitting me as hard as
   she could, and of course I was just play hitting. It's never come 
   up before, so I have no idea of the etiquette of playfighting. I
   suppose it's not done to playfight at all any more, but she's just
   so cute when she snarls at me with her perfectly straight tiny
   teeth, and thumps me with her tiny ineffectual fists. It's like
   being menaced by a chinchilla.
</p>
<hr />

<p>We watched Prince of Egypt today, admittedly a week late for Passover.
   I had forgotten how great that movie is. We bought it, so we can watch
   it as often as we like. Every Passover! We don't do anything else
   for Passover, apart from eat a lot at Baba's house, so why not 
   create our own traditions?

   we would like to hear what you think of it, and how we can make it even
   better.
</p>
<p>There are some things we’re particularly interested in (mostly on the “Disk
   space” tab), such as:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     Are your existing settings preserved?
 </li>

 <li>
     If you have no previous settings do we choose “Do not Synchronize” by
     default?
 </li>

 <li>
     For those of you who choose not to synchronize your messages, does that appear to work correctly?
 </li>
</ol>
<p>We also have some more general questions, like:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
     Does it look okay?  Do the sizes seem correct?
 </li>

 <li>
     Do the options make sense, and how can we make them clearer?
 </li>

 <li>
     Do the buttons work the way you think they should?
 </li>
</ol>

<div class="storyTitle"><a class="taggedlink" name="april10" href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/everythingelse/april10.html"><b>What Up?</b></a>
<div class="storyCategory">[/amy/everythingelse]</div></div>
<div class="storyBody"><p>I used to have a blog here, but lately I've been busy with
   this paying job thing and haven't been blogging much. I have
   about eighteen million books to blog about, and everything
   else. This is going to be the everything else post.
</p>

<h4>Delphine</h4>
<p>Delphine is nearly seven and she's become all happy and patient and
   agreeable. Well, not <em>all</em>, but more than before. She sometimes
   doesn't respond when Cordelia tries to fight with her; she sometimes goes
   along with me when I ask her to do stuff she doesn't want to;
   she is usually happy after school and she seldom complains about
   her day. She's no Pollyanna, but she's not quite as emo and 
   gloomy as she has been through most of the last year.
</p>
<p>Delphine had her first piano lesson last Saturday. Piano lessons
   now are so much cooler than when I started playing: instead of
   starting with "this is a staff and this is a quarter note" it
   starts with "these are your fingers and this is the keyboard"
   and you plunk away, and notation is introduced as needed and no
   sooner. 
</p>
<p>So Delphine loves piano. She couldn't wait to get home to practice,
   and she has practiced every day this week.
</p>

<h4>Cordelia</h4>
<p>Cordelia is still happy, sweet Cordelia. She tells me she loves me 
   eighteen million times a day and she does little dances. She loves her
   friends, too&mdash;she and Anna won't go into the kindergarten 
   playground without the other.
</p>
<p>I wonder, sometimes, if Cordelia's always going to be the sweet, frivolous
   contrast to Delphine's darker personality. No, that's not quite right.
   What I wonder is how Cordelia's bubbliness will make the transition
   to adulthood. Where is she going to get that gravity that surely
   adulthood demands?
</p>
<p>For now it seems like along with gloominess, Delphine
   also has a lock on scepticism, bookishness, and intellectualism 
   (inasmuch as a six-year-old can be intellectual). Cordelia's only
   "things" are that she runs really fast (and a lot) and sings
   well. I guess I worry that Delphine's going to be "the clever
   one", leaving some other identity for Cordelia. I suppose even if
   she isn't "the clever one" she'll still be clever and she can
   always leverage that in whatever she ends up doing with herself.
</p>
<p>Anyway, there's nothing so sure as that they'll be what they'll
   be and I have much less control over what they'll be than I'd
   like to think.
</p>

<h4>Me</h4>
<p>As for me, I have got myself a paying job. I'm copyediting and
   laying out a non-fiction book for self-publishing. A while
   ago I said that I didn't think copyediting would be a great
   job for me because it's so picky-picky; as it turns out it's
   a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I do love to proofread
   things, and even the totally anal stuff is kind of cool. I like
   knowing what kind of dash to use (even if I don't always bother
   to use the right one) and whether "BCE" has periods or not. And
   the meticulousness you need to employ to keep track of the 
   style decisions you've made is right up my list-making alley.
</p>
<p>I do need to reread Strunk and White, and some other writing books,
   just to clarify what makes good writing good, and I feel like
   I should put my hands on some style guides. (I wonder if people buy
   those on paper or just, I dunno, subscribe to them online or something.)
</p>
<p>This working gig is going to have to get a lot more real in
   September. I signed Cordelia up for daycare when she was just over a
   year old, and as it turns out she got in. She starts in September
   at the daycare at the school. I won't have Delphine in daycare
   ("It's not FAIR!") but I will send her to school with a lunch, so
   my work day will be from 9:00 until 3:00. My plan, such that it is,
   is to work a twenty-hour week, leaving me ten hours a week for such
   frivolity as housework, exercise, reading and getting my nails done.
   Maybe I'll skip the nails and read more.
</p>
<p>I'm reading a rather intense (but very useful) book about 
   starting a home-based
   writing business. The author is quite intent on my making a business
   plan, planning further education, budgeting, marketing, and all
   that sensible, grown-up stuff. I almost feel like I can't waste
   my time doing that stuff when I could be doing billable work&mdash;kind
   of like the kid who runs his bike all the way to school because he
   doesn't have time to get on. I'm also resisting doing all that
   business stuff because somehow I can't take myself that seriously
   as a professional freelance writer and copyeditor. Clearly I'm 
   going to have to get over that, but fortunately I have a few months
   to do it.

<div class="storyCategory">[/amy/letters]</div></div>
<div class="storyBody"><p>I've been thinking I should really take some driving lessons to
   get over my fear of scary big city driving. Since I already have
   a driver's license, I don't need actual in-class
   lessons, I only need a few hours in one of those cars with the extra
   set of brakes, so I emailed a couple of driving schools to see if I could
   do that. Here is what I received in response from AllWheels Drivers:
</p>
<blockquote>
were do you live and do you have ontario G1 licence.<br />
IF YOU ONLY HAVE SASK. licence you will have to get your G1 licence inder take driviong lessons.
</blockquote>

<p>I shit you not, I didn't change a single letter of that email.
   If you're keeping track, that's three spelling errors, two missing
   capital letters, one missing question mark, a whole lot of pointless
   ALLCAPS, and one incomprehensible phrase ("inder take driviong lessons"?)
</p>
<p>I was going to send a polite email explaining why this
   isn't a good way to handle customer response, but it seems I can't
   be bothered and would just rather blog about it here. I'm passive-aggressive
   like that.
</p>
<p>Since then I've received a recommendation for another driving school
   from a friend. I won't be emailing them.

<div class="storyCategory">[/blake/tech/thunderbird/ucosp]</div></div>
<div class="storyBody"><p>For your reading pleasure this week, we have a guest post from <a href="mailto:wxwoo@uwaterloo.ca">Wei Xian
Woo</a>.  Wei is a student working on
   <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/">Thunderbird</a> as part of
   <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/">UCOSP</a>, and has just had <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=408338">his first
bug</a> marked as
   FIXED.  Anyways, that’s enough out of me.  Here’s Wei’s post:
</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Programming Thunderbird in Visual Studio.</h3>
<p>During this term’s Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects (UCOSP)
   Code Sprint held at the University of Toronto in January, I wrote a
   simple Python script for the Thunderbird team to make setting up a
   Visual C++ project for Thunderbird slightly easier for those of us
   working on Windows. Blake suggested making this script public so others
   could benefit from it, so here it is! The script is generic enough to be
   used for any project, not just Thunderbird. Feel free to use it and make
   modifications as you see fit :)
</p>

<h3>Using the script to create a Visual C++ project for Thunderbird</h3>
<p>Create an empty Visual C++ project in Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>From the command prompt launched by mozilla-buildstart-msvc9.bat, do:
</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>python /path/to/refreshvcproj.py
--vcproj=/path/to/thunderbird.vcproj --dir=/path/to/gecko-sdk
--dir=/path/to/mozilla/comm-central/mozilla/xpcom
--dir=/path/to/mozilla/comm-central/mail
</pre></div>
<p>All files in the specified directories will be included in the project.
   I suggest including only the directories you will be working with.
</p>

<h3>Configuring the project for debugging:</h3>
<p>Open the VC++ project file in Visual Studio, and then open the project's
   Properties.
</p>
<p>Go to: Configuration Properties -&gt; Debugging.
</p>
<p>Set Command to pathtoobjdirmozilladistbinthunderbird.exe
</p>
<p>Set Environment to XPCOM_DEBUG_BREAK=warn
</p>

<h3>And… you’re done!</h3>
<p>For better C++ IntelliSense, you might also want to consider getting
   Visual Assist X (an add-on for VS).
</p>

<h3>Happy coding!</h3>
</blockquote><p>And you can find the script <a href="/static/blake/refreshvcproj.py">over here</a>.
</p>
<p>Thanks, Wei!

<div class="storyTitle"><a class="taggedlink" name="identity" href="http://weblog.latte.ca/amy/unsolicited%20advice/identity.html"><b>Something's Gotta Go&mdash;For a While</b></a>
<div class="storyCategory">[/amy/unsolicited advice]</div></div>
<div class="storyBody"><p>I went to Starbucks this morning to treat myself to my usual decaf
   tall non-fat with-whip mocha (personal), and there was a lady behind me in line 
   with a baby and a five-year-old boy. The boy was a handful&mdash;at
   one point he disappeared into the kitchen, and he didn't want to stand
   still and wait in line. The mom was obviously tired, anxious and overwhelmed.
   Meanwhile, baby in one hand, Blackberry in the other, she was calling
   friends cheerily asking what kind of coffee they took.  You know when
   you watch someone make a phone call and their whole mood changes when
   they're on the call? It was like that: <em>tired grumpy tired HAPPY BRIGHT HAPPY
tired grumpy tired</em>
</p>
<p>First of all, why would you put on yourself the extra work of getting
   coffee for all your friends when you have your hands full with your
   kids? It's okay to drop a few things when you have little kids.
   Maybe not cleaning the toilet and showering, but bringing coffee is definitely
   expendable. And second, why be all happy and "Hey, I'm 
   bringing you coffee!" to your friends while only 
   the strangers in Starbucks get to see how anxious and overwhelmed you
   are. Your friends don't care about coffee, they care about you.  (The strangers
   at Starbucks don't care about you, they care about coffee.) It's okay to
   tell your friends that you're overwhelmed and you're going to beg off
   bringing coffee for a while.  You can be the coffee and treats 
   bringer again when your little one is old enough to carry a bag of croissants.
</p>
<hr />

<p>I guess I have two points. First, if you're feeling overwhelmed, you're
   not doing anyone any favours pretending everything's fine. Mostly people
   will believe you, and you won't get the help you need, which sucks.
   But just as bad is the overly
   optimistic impression you're giving other parents of the level of 
   busy-ness and achievement they should be able to manage.
</p>
<p>And second, when you have little kids you have to set aside some of
   your old identity. (Unless your old identity included about ten hours
   a day of absolute sloth, in which case parenting will fit in just fine.
   Except you'll have to set aside the "I'm slothful" part of your old 
   identity. No, I'm going to stick with my original claim&mdash;when
   you have kids you have to set something aside.) Maybe it's being a
   great housekeeper, maybe it's being an employed person, maybe it's
   being a gym rat, maybe it's being someone who sees all the latest
   movies, maybe it's being the one who brings the coffee. When you 
   add a baby to your life something has to give. 
</p>
<p>But it doesn't have to
   give forever: when you're stuck at home with a four-month-old and you're
   staring down the abyss of babyhood and toddlerdom and preschoolerness
   it seems like everything you ever loved about your old life is gone
   for good, or at least unrecognizably mangled. But if you just wait,
   you'll get it back. Your kid will be able to walk so you can carry
   an extra coffee; your kid will go to preschool so you can go to the
   gym; your kid will start school or daycare so you can work.
</p>
<p>When you have a baby it seems like you have to hang on to everything
   about yourself until your fingernails bleed, that if you don't you'll
   lose yourself completely in snot and diapers. But all that stuff that
   made you you is still in there. It will still be there for you in
   three or four or five years when your hands are free and you have a 
   minute or two to yourself.
</p>
<hr />

<p>Wow, that turned way more profound than I meant it to.

<div class="storyBody"><p>I posted this as a comment over at <a href="http://www.hollie.us/">Hollie's
   blog</a> and thought I should put it here too.
</p>
<p>We were at the grocery store today and Blake and Cordelia were 
   having conversations on the pretend phone – you know the one 
   you make with your little finger and thumb outstretched?
</p>
<p>Well, Cordelia called Blake and said, “Is Mummy there?” Actually, 
   what she said was “Give it to Mummy”, but she meant “Is Mummy there?”
</p>
<p>So Blake held his pretend phone up to my face, and I said, “Hello?”
</p>
<p>Cordelia paused, giggled, and said, “Bye!”
</p>
<p>That’s right, she prank-called me on the <em>pretend phone</em>.

<li><a href="http://twitter.com/Iko/status/22914013307">@Iko</a> Yeah, if I was still playing games, I might buy a console, but I so don't have the time for them anymore.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/Iko/status/22913424011">@Iko</a> OMG!  That's what I use my Mac Mini for!  ;) (And for @EccentricFlower, it can also do more!)</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/deadsquid/status/22911725999">@deadsquid</a> I'm pretty sure if it generated a list for anyone, it would include Lady GaGa, Kate Perry, etc…  It's all about selling songs. ;)</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/lynngr/status/22893790558">@lynngr</a> It's been my experience that bikes come to a complete stop at those about as often as cars do. (I always stop, for what it's worth.)</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/pilky/status/22891954414">@pilky</a> Much better.  If you wanted to improve it more, "let" is a keyword in JS 1.8, and the "show" on the third line should be a function.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/pilky/status/22890334284">@pilky</a> So, I'm too lazy to install CCPro, but I'ld like to see how http://pastebin.mozilla.org/781535 renders under the old and new systems.</li>
<li>RT++ @dethe: @andymckay For imagemagick (and pretty much anything unix-y) remove darwinports or fink and use homebrew http://bit.ly/WMVgT</li>
