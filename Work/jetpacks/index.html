    <h2>Twenty-Sided Moderator Comment Marker</h2>

    <div class="span-24">A thing that annoyed me recently was that
    after the <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1352"
    >big redesign</a> at Twenty Sided, I could no longer search for
    Shamus:” to see all the comments that Shamus posted (and to be fair,
    that search term wouldn’t show me anything that Josh, Rutskarn, or
    Mumbles posted), so this morning, I spent a little more time in the <a
    href="https://builder.mozillalabs.com/" >Jetpack Builder</a> and in
    Firebug, and came up with a Jetpack to add the text "READ ME!" just
    before every comment from a moderator.</div>

    <div class="span-24">You can <a href="20-sided-comment-marker.xpi">get
    the Twenty-Sided Moderator Comment Marker here</a>, or <a
    href="https://builder.mozillalabs.com/addon/1001926/latest/">view the
    source here</a>.</div>

    <div class="span-24">But since that doesn’t seem to work anymore, I’ve
    written a <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">GreaseMonkey</a> script,
    which you can find <a href="twenty-sided_comment_mar.user.js"
    >here</a>.</div>

    <h2>Embiggen Viddler</h2>

    <div class="span-24"> There are a <a
    href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/SpoilerWarning/videos/" >number of
    videos</a> I like to watch, mainly on Viddler, but the regular size is
    a little too small for me to make out all the details, and full-screen
    mode, while large enough, doesn’t let me flip around to other windows
    while retaining the large size.  So I found myself running a second
    copy of <a href="http://www.getfirefox.net/">Firefox</a>, with <a
    href="http://getfirebug.com/">FireBug</a> enabled, and manually changed
    the widths and heights of the proper elements every time I wanted to
    watch a video.  I finally got tired of doing it all the time, and so I
    created a Jetpack to double the width and height of any Viddler
    video.</div>
