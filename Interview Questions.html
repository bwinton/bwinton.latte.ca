    <h1>Interview Questions From Col.</h1>
<p>Answer using complete sentences. Use extra paper if necessary.</p>

<p>1. OK, it strikes me that the first and foremost significant
factor in your life, at least at the moment, is that you have
this amazing small human creature in your environment. Tell me
about fatherhood. Tell me about the ways it's changed your life,
for good or bad, including the surprises nobody warned you about.
In fact, especially those. Tell me about the way it's changed
your relationship with the other adults in your life as well -
not just your wife but friends, other couples, family, strangers
on the street, anything that comes to mind ....</p>

<p>A.  That wasn't a question.  No real changes, boring person
before, Del's just a good excuse to leave early/kick people out.
Less free time, not that I did much with it.  Always looking out
for someone else, but brought up in a household where that was
the norm, just thinking about it differently.  I think everyone
warned us about all the stuff that would happen, and a lot more
besides, but I didn't pay much attention, for a few reasons.
Because there was so much advice and warnings I couldn't possibly
hope to remember them all, and since I think well on my feet, I
figured that even <strike>if</strike> when I didn't know what was
wrong, I would be able to handle it, I didn't even bother trying
to remember any of it.  Further, I've seen a lot of advice given,
and most of it has been bad (story about Morgan & Mom &
toothpaste on a wasp bite) so I'm generally inclined to nod
politely and go doing what I was going to do.  And finally,
pretty much everyone who gave us recommendations brought their
own baggage to the table, very little of which seems to apply to
Delphine, since she is a far better baby than we could have hoped
for, so most of the things we would have prepared for didn't
happen.  The one thing that I was warned about, which I didn't
really understand at the time, is how completely I love her.  Rob
said it better than I can, but I would and will do anything in my
power to protect her and make her life as fun as it can be.</p>

<p>2. How do you deal with geekdom? In general, the interests we've
discussed and have in common are the kind of interests that have
passionate devotees, and usually ALSO the kind of interests that
make people's eyes glaze over if they're not "in the faith." I
know there have been many times when we've had tech conversations
and had to either take it private or risk driving the rest of the
chatroom crazy. Does having those sorts of passionate, somewhat
niche-y interests bother you? Do you ever find yourself having to
compensate for your geekdoms in conversation with other humans,
dodge certain topics, or step down the level of complexity when
discussing them, or what-have-you?</p>

<p>B.  Kathryn, Mom & Dad, Morg, Douglas & Tanya, Carrie.</p>

<p>3. In that vein, tell me about some of your hobbies, interests
and preoccupations that are neither Delphine- or
computer-related. Surprise me. Give me ones I couldn't have
guessed in a million years that you have.</p>

<p>C.  Body modification/punk scene?
Linguistics/learning Hebrew?
Municipal politics/sociology?
Music theory/learning piano?</p>

<p>4. Why Toronto? OK, granted, some of it is because it's always
been there for you, but what are the good points about living
there? What are the bad points? And have you ever seriously
considered living anywhere else?</p>

<p>D.  Good: (The people.  Odd because I don't like people
generally.  Excitement.  Diversity.  Food.) Transit.  Clean.
Large but Canadian.
Bad: 
Other: New Zealand.</p>

<p>5. This is almost too obvious a question, but I'm dying to get it
on record, so forgive me: I'd like to know why you think
Americans and Canadians are always abusing each other, each in
their peculiar way. I'd like to know if you think that dislike
for each other is mostly real or mostly trumped-up, and what you
think the REAL state of US/Canada relations - in terms of the
little people, not political leaders - is today. Is there hope?
Also, why is our national temperament so different from yours
(assuming you think it IS that different)?</p>

<p>E. Reading "Lies my teacher told me"</p>
