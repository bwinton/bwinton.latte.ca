  <h1>A Sudoku Importer</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Sudoku Importer is a program which takes a set of Sudoku
    puzzles in a memo, and imports them all into Andrew Gregory's
    Sudoku program for the Palm.  The format of Sudoku puzzles should
    be as follows:<br/>
    <code>% Sudoku From Wikipedia<br/>
    53..7....<br/>
    6..195...<br/>
    .98....6.<br/>
    8...6...3<br/>
    4..8.3..1<br/>
    7...2...6<br/>
    .6....28.<br/>
    ...419..5<br/>
    ....8..79<br/>
    </code>
    Note that the title must start with "<code>% </code>", which gets
    removed when the puzzle is imported.</p>

    <p>How, you may ask, does one get Sudoku puzzles in this format
    into my Palm's Memo Pad?  Conveniently, I have a program written
    in Python which will hit a site and download a configurable number
    (currently 20) of their puzzles, outputting them in the above
    format.  However, the site I was getting the puzzles from asked me
    to not use them as a Sudoku source, and so I'm in the middle of
    updating the program to get its puzzles from another site.  And
    while I was doing that, someone pointed a program out to me that
    would generate Sudoku puzzles, so I think I'll use that
    instead.</p>

    <h3>Yet-to-be-implemented Features</h3>     
    <ul>
      <li>Handle the case where the Sudoku program is on a memory
        stick.  (Thanks, Ben Cordes.)</li>
      <li>Figure out what's causing the "Query Error" messages.
	(Thanks, Greg Balls.)</li>
      <li>Add some more in-app documentation/help.</li>
      <li>Please <a
      href="mailto:bwinton+sudoku@latte.ca?subject=Sudoku Importer
 Suggestion">email me</a> with any suggestions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Yet-to-be-fixed Bugs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Successful importing of puzzles can result in an error code
        of 9 or possibly 12, depending on whether there's a blank line
        at the end of your puzzles.  I should really change that.

      <li>Figure out what's causing the "Query Error" messages.
