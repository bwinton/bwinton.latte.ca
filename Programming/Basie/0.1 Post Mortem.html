<h1>Basie 0.1 Post-Mortem Notes.</h1>

<h2>Positive Stuff.</h2>

<h3>People.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>Everyone did a freaking incredible job.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Everybody gave more than the expected/requested/paid for hours.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The team produced some remarkably clean code in a very short time,
     given its prior lack of exposure to Django.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Distributed collaboration worked much better than expected (much
     better than many professional/open source teams).
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>It was good that Greg stayed above the programming part, and swooped
     in when we needed him.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Having outstanding expertise on some of the features (i.e. on mail
     from Blake)
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Meetings.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>Weekly Meetings: I liked the idea of weekly meetings in irc, i think
     it helped keep things on track and provided an update as to what
     every one was doing. It also provide a time when you knew every one
     would be online if you needed information from them.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Meetings were run well, with good organization and speed.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Meetings were useful. Let's keep them up.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication.</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
     Mail list: The mail list was a rather effective means of
       communicating with the rest of the team and seemed to work nicely.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools and Supporting Code.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>Regular, frequent, small commits went well/were a good idea.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>pyflakes and pep8: Both where a great tool for checking code and
     style however it would have been nice if we had a script to run both
     on all files in Basie in one command.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Tests: Very useful :)
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>pep8 and pyflakes, mail list and irc
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Reviews.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>Code reviews threw the mailing list: Having mailman automatically
     send an e-mail when there is a commit and reviews replied to it
     seemed to work very well. It also was a good indication of what was
     being worked on at the moment and how active things where. The down
     side was it cluttered up my inbox rather fast.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Assigning some one to code reviews: I think code reviews worked well
     when some one was assigned to just work on doing reviews and leaving
     the other developers time to code. It lead to better reviews as the
     person doing the reviews did not worry about having time to finish
     the code they are working on and could take the time to go threw all
     the commits.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Reviews: Great job with the reviews. It should be maintained next
     term.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Code reviews were very helpful when they explained what was wrong.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Blake's code reviews set a great example; it was even greater that
     so many people followed suit and created a culture of continuous
     feedback.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Code review was really good in theory but the way we were doing it
     was suck.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Negative</h2>

<h3>Code Reviews.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>Code review was really good in theory but the way we were doing it
     was suck.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>My biggest disappointment was that the mail application was code
     reviewed and merged several times into the beta branch. Then, near
     the end, suddenly it turns out that some of the people weren't
     satisfied with it. So, I guess, no last minute out-of-the-blue code
     reviews of the past would help.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Code reviews often had "do this 'cause i say so" mentality. We all
     have different coding styles or even ways at how we approach a
     problem. Bending to someone's else's wishes without being given a
     reason does not constitute learning and, that's what army is for.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Tempers were strained occasionally during reviews and design
     discussions (more considerate language should have been used).
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h3>People.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>I wish I wasn't so killed with school/work/etc.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>We thought that the final meeting would just be a small basie
     gathering, disappointed that so many outsiders were there.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Our distributed team made it hard for the less experienced to ramp
     up their knowledge; part of this was a hesitance to ask for feedback
     on the list, but the lack of immediacy hampered them as well.  Someone
     wishes they had more give and take that you get in face to face
     discussions.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Juggling project members. I think that the team that starts working
     on an application should finish it.  It was unfair to take people
     out cold leaving their work undone and for other people to clean up
     and finish. So, if this happens in the future, it would be nice to
     give a little time at least for the person to finish up something
     that works or is easier to manage.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Greg was over-optimistic: set goals that were unachievable given how
     new most of the dev team was, was too willing to believe that people
     had finished things and were ready to move on.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Greg was too indulgent: should not have given ground on support for
     multiple version control systems (if those hours had gone into
     building a wiki, we'd have had one for 0.1).
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Greg didn't (and doesn't) understand the technology that the project
     was (and is) using, which meant he could only wave his hands and
     pontificate when hard decisions needed to be made.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Branches and Merging.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>We ended up having too many stale branches; we were moving to new
     features with finishing what we started.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>svnmerge was a pain
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>svnmerge: The svnmerge.py script was a massive pain to work with and
     i think it often lead to more work then it saved.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Merges: In the last part we had several problems to merge the
     different branches. I do not know if someone discovered the cause,
     but perhaps the problem was not to follow the rule: parent --&gt; child
     branch and child --&gt; parent branch. Next term we probably should
     merge only trunk --&gt; branch and branch --&gt; trunk.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Effort put into svnmerge etc. outweighed value returned.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>It'll be obvious who this is coming from, but subversion is not the
     ideal tool for our situation.  We're an open source, distributed
     team using lots of branches and svn does not help us with that
     workflow.  Serious consideration should be put into looking at other
     systems, how they'd benefit our collaboration, and the drawbacks
     from devs learning an unfamiliar system and reworking our habits.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>Should have more discussion on list, don't be afraid to ask.  Those
     with experience want to share their knowledge, but it's hard if we
     don't know the problem.  Reviews should not be the time for
     discovering that you don't understand something.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Blog: I found that the blog was not used very effectively and just
     added a layer of confusion about where to post to.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Blog: We could increase the use of the blog. It will be nice if we
     document the main features of the apps. I had the opportunity to see
     the development of some apps, but there are others which I don't
     know almost nothing.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>A lot of times people seemed to be waffling around without knowing
     what to do.  That could partially be caused by the newness of what
     we were doing, but I think the newer devs could use more focused
     direction (akin to class assignments).  Having faster iterations on
     branches could help here as well.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Release.</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
     The release process kind of fell apart, the code freeze never really
       happened.  We should have been more willing to cut code, and
       refactoring shouldn't be put off.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools and Supporting Code.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>Basie has too much code without tests, and too many bugs got fixed
     without an accompanying test.  Some people complained about spending too
     much time fixing the tests, but I think that problem stemmed
     from tests that copied too much instead of making a function, not
     keeping the tests focused, and also their newness at writing tests.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Dependencies: I know the virtualenv works for you but I have to
     download the dependencies one by one (I can't use buildout). It will
     be nice if you also document (if they are not in
     http://basieproject.org/eggs/) where I can find them.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>

<h3>Code Reviews.</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>Reviews are awesome, but we need more reviewers.  It may not be easy
     at first, but gets easier with practice.  You learn how to read
     faster, you get more familiar with the code you're reading.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Don't skip the reviews that aren't specifically for you.  Reviews
     are for everyone to learn, I'm wasting my time with involved
     explanations if only 1 other person is reading it.  Reviewers don't
     want to correct the same problems over and over, it's boring and
     frustrating.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>We need a better review process (I despise the email conv on a diff
     patch)...but this likely won't be fixed until we get a code review
     tool we can dog feed ourselves.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>Do you have any ideas on what sorts of things you'ld like from a
     review tool?
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>I'm impressed with a lot of what Google Code has...but a code
     review tool is a feature on Greg's radar that I'll likely be
     involved with, so it's just a waiting game there.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

 </li>

 <li><p>More people designated to be review-only.  Blake can't do everything
     ;).
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Branches.</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
     Have quicker turn around; try to shoot for branches less than 1 week
       old, max 2 weeks.  We'll be better prepared for a release, people
       will have a better sense of forward progress.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dogfood!</h3>
<ul>
 <li><p>We could increase the use of tickets for the next term.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Start using Basie! Self-hosting!
</p>

 </li>
</ul>
