  <h1>OnBoardC Notes</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>Because I haven't seen any explanations of the internals of
       OnBoardC yet, and as someone who is trying to modify the
       behaviour of OnBoardC, I think that there should be more of
       this information written down.</p>

    <h3>Tracing String Constants.  (From Steve Little)</h3>
    <p>the function expression(...)  is the place you want to look.</p>
    <p>it calls compileExpression, which parses and compiles a single
       expression (recursively, thus dealing with subexpressions etc),
       generating a tree of Nodes.</p>
    <p>it then calls getCodeForExpression(), which calls
       generateCode() to recurse the tree of Nodes, outputting (asm)
       code to a new document, and cleaning up Nodes as it goes.</p>

    <h3>Merging Adjacent String Constants.  (Also from Steve Little.)</h3>
    <p>When we find adjacent string constants, they should be chained
       together in the tree (ie, the second string becomes a child
       StringConstantNode of the first). This would probably be done
       inside parseExpression, by calling GetNextToken, checking if
       it's another DoubleQuote, then adding it on. (in a loop,
       probably)</p>
    <p>Then, in codegen.c, inside addCodeStringConstant, loop through
       the chain of adjacent strings, writing the concatenated result
       out, and calculating the combined length</p>
    <p>I've got an initial cut of this seemingly working, and would
       like other people to test it out, and let me know how it works
       for them.  You can find it <a href="OnBoardC.prc">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Macro Expansion.</h3>
    <p>To be filled in later...</p>

    <h3>Other Stuff.</h3>
    <p>Please, let me know if there are any other bits of information
       that might be useful for people who want to add features to
       OnBoardC to know.</p>
