    <h1>Diablo II</h1>
  
    <p>I've currently got two and a half characters on the go. The
half a character is a Barbarian who I've hacked to have stats of 255
in everything.  I'm not really playing him, I just use him when I want
to "boot some head".  And since I don't play on-line, I don't feel too
badly about it.</p>

    <p>My first character was a Necromancer, named Taliesin.  He died
mainly because he thought he was a barbarian, and tried to go toe to
toe with Blood Raven.  I guess that's what happens when you start
feeling invincible.  It's the minions fault.  They just plowed through
everything.  I rarely got hit.  I thought I could take it.  I guess
not.</p>

    <p>My Next character is a Paladin named Uther.  His stats are:<br>

<br>He doesn't have a Tome of Identify, because he's already rescued
the ultimate Tome of Identify, Deckard Cain.</p>
