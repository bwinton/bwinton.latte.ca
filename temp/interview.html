        <b>OK, it strikes me that the first and foremost significant factor in
        your life, at least at the moment, is that you have this amazing small
        human creature in your environment. Tell me about fatherhood. Tell me
        about the ways it's changed your life, for good or bad, including the
        surprises nobody warned you about. In fact, especially those. Tell me
        about the way it's changed your relationship with the other adults in
        your life as well - not just your wife but friends, other couples,
        family, strangers on the street, anything that comes to mind
        ....</b><br /><br />
        
        There haven't been any truly major changes in my life since Del arrived,
        which I attribute to my being a fairly boring person.  I seem to have
        gotten all the drinking, smoking, and drunken carousing out of my system
        in University, and since then I've been a big, lazy, homebody.  In that
        respect, the major change Del has introduced is that I now have a good
        excuse to leave a party early or kick people out of my house.  Another
        major life change, as you might have noticed from my blinking red name
        on Lisa's interviewee's page is that I have much less free time now than
        I used to, so the simplest of tasks, like answering five interview
        questions, for instance, takes me far, far longer than I think it will. 
        To be fair to Del I didn't really do that much with my free time before
        she came, but now that she's here I seem to be looking back fondly on
        the copious amounts of spare time I used to have.  I have noticed that
        I'm always thnking about Del when I'm with her, and what I can do to
        make her life better or easier, and that's a bit of a change, but I was
        brought up in a household where anticipating other people's needs was
        the norm, so it's not as big a change as it might be.  (My father would
        get very upset when we couldn't read his mind, and bring him what he
        needed before he asked for it.  He was a little insane back then, but
        he's gotten a lot better these days, and can laugh about it when we
        throw it back in his face.)<br /><br />
        
        Other than that, I think everyone warned us about any possible thing
        that could go wrong, and a bunch of things that couldn't, but I didn't
        really pay much attention to them for a few reasons.  Because there was
        so much advice and suggestions of things to do, and so many warnings of
        things that we should not do, I couldn't possibly hope to remember them
        all, and since one of my main strengths is that I think well on my feet,
        I figured that even <strike>if</strike> when I didn't know what was
        wrong, I would be able to handle it at least as well as if I had
        memorized all of the advice.
        
        <!-- Preliminary Notes. --><br /><br />
        Further, I've seen a lot of advice given, and most of it has been bad
        (story about Morgan &amp; Mom &amp; toothpaste on a wasp bite) so I'm
        generally inclined to nod politely and go doing what I was going to do.
        And finally, pretty much everyone who gave us recommendations brought
        their own baggage to the table, very little of which seems to apply to
        Delphine, since she is a far better baby than we could have hoped for,
        so most of the things we would have prepared for didn't happen. The one
        thing that I was warned about, which I didn't really understand at the
        time, is how completely I love her. Rob said it better than I can, but
        I would and will do anything in my power to protect her and make her
        life as fun as it can be.<br /><br />

        <b>How do you deal with geekdom? In general, the interests we've
        discussed and have in common are the kind of interests that have
        passionate devotees, and usually ALSO the kind of interests that make
        people's eyes glaze over if they're not "in the faith." I know there
        have been many times when we've had tech conversations and had to
        either take it private or risk driving the rest of the chatroom crazy.
        Does having those sorts of passionate, somewhat niche-y interests
        bother you? Do you ever find yourself having to compensate for your
        geekdoms in conversation with other humans, dodge certain topics, or
        step down the level of complexity when discussing them, or
        what-have-you?</b><br /><br />

        are the bad points? And have you ever seriously considered living

        <b>This is almost too obvious a question, but I'm dying to get it on
        record, so forgive me: I'd like to know why you think Americans and
        Canadians are always abusing each other, each in their peculiar way.
        I'd like to know if you think that dislike for each other is mostly
        real or mostly trumped-up, and what you think the REAL state of
        US/Canada relations - in terms of the little people, not political
        leaders - is today. Is there hope? Also, why is our national
        temperament so different from yours (assuming you think it IS that
        different)?</b><br /><br />
