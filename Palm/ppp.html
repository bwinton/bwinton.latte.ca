  <h1>Connecting a Palm Vx to Windows XP with PPP.</h1>

  <p>I have been trying to connect my Palm Vx to the internet
  through my Windows XP box at work for quite some time now, and
  have had little success with it until today.  There was a
  program called "MochaPPP" which worked for a while, but I
  didn't want to pay money for something which I'm doing mainly
  as a hobby, so I let the trial period run out, and went without
  connectivity for a while.  Today (Sept 18<sup>th</sup>),
  however, I've finally got it working, thanks to some
  instructions on <a href="http://www.lan.com/otto/tivo3xp/">a
  Tivo hacking page</a>.  I'm now going to copy the instructions
  from there, just in case they go down.</p>

<h1>How to setup Tivo 3.0 to talk to Windows XP via Serial
PPP</h1>
<p>The usefulness of this is clear: it lets you do your daily
calls over your high speed internet connection without getting a
TivoNet or TurboNet card.</p>
<p>Quick Tip: Already got a TivoNet or TurboNet card? - Tivo
added TivoNet and TurboNet support as well. This is a quick easy
answer on how to use that: Install the card, connect it to the
network, have a DHCP server running somewhere, plug the Tivo in,
put ",#401" in the Tivo's dialing prefix. Voila, it now dials
over the ethernet. Nice. :D</p>


<hr>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Tivo running 3.0 or above software.</li>
<li>A PC with a serial port nearby running Windows XP.</li>
<li>A null modem cable connecting the two.</li>
<li>An understanding of your LAN setup and how networking
works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is NOT the same as previous Tivo to Serial via
PPP setups. This only works with the new built in serial PPP
method in 3.0. The main difference: It's not "always on". It
connects when the Tivo wants to dial in, and disconnects when the
Tivo is done dialing. This is *not* suitable if you want to hook
your box up to use TivoWeb or some such remote connectivity via
the internet.</p>
<p>Also note that this is totally unsupported by Tivo. Do not
call them for help with it. Go to the <a
href=http://www.tivocommunity.com>Tivo Community Forums</a> and
look in the Underground if you have problems.</p>


<hr>
<p>This has only been tested on XP, but it may work on 2000 as
well. The methods are similar.</p>

<p>After you save this inf file, delete the corresponding pnf
file (c:\windows\inf\mdmhayes.pnf), and reboot XP.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Create a "modem"</h2>
<p>Open the Phone and Modems control panel.</p>
<img src="pppPics/phone5.gif">
<p>Click Add</p>
<img src="pppPics/phone3.gif">
<p>Select Don't Detect and hit Next</p>
<img src="pppPics/phone4.gif">
<p>Select "Communications Cable Between Two Computers" and hit
next</p>
<img src="pppPics/phone6.gif">
<p>Select the COM port you have connected the null modem cable to
the Tivo to and hit Next</p>
<img src="pppPics/phone7.gif">
<p>If you get this dialog, Select Continue Anyway. When it
finishes setting it up, you should have a new modem, like so:</p>
<img src="pppPics/phone1.gif">
<p>Select the modem and hit properties, then select the "Modem"
tab</p>
<img src="pppPics/phone2.gif">
<p>Set the maximum port speed to 115,200. You can use other port
speeds if you like, but you'll need to change the Tivo code to
accomodate this. More on this later.</p>


<hr>
<h2>Step 3: Create an incoming connection for the Tivo</h2>
<p>Click Start->Connect To->Show All Connections, and then select
"Create new connection" from the Network tasks menu on the left
bar.</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom1.gif">
<p>Click Next</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom2.gif">
<p>Select "Setup an Advanced Connection" and click Next</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom3.gif">
<p>Select "Accept Incoming Connections" and click Next</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom4.gif">
<p>Select the new modem entry you made and click next</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom5.gif">
<p>Select "Do Not Allow VPN Connections" (it's not needed for
this connection) and click Next</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom6.gif">
<p>Make sure Guest is checked and click Next</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom7.gif">
<p>Select the Internet protocol and click Properties</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom8.gif">
<p>First, make sure "Allow callers access..." is checked. If you
have a DHCP server on your network (like a Linksys cable/dsl
router doing DHCP), then select "Assign TCP/IP addresses
automatically...". If you use static IP addressing, then Select
"Specify TCP/IP..." and put in an address range. You cannot put
the same address in as the start and end of the range, so you
have to have a range of at least 2 addresses. In my experience,
the Tivo always gets the start address when it connects using
this method. In any case, make your choice and hit OK, then hit
Next.</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom9.gif">
<p>Click Finish. Now, right click on the new incoming connection
you just made and select properties then the Users tab.</p>
<img src="pppPics/incom10.gif">
<p>Turn on "Always allow directly connected devices..."</p>
<p>Also, click on the General Tab, select the "communications
cable.." and hit properties. Then set the Flow Control to "None".
(Sorry, no screenshot of this yet)</p>


<hr>
<h2>Step 4: Tell the Tivo to use the serial port</h2>
<p>Put ",#211" in as the dial prefix and run a test call. When
the Tivo gets to connecting, you should see a new "Unregistered
User" appear next to the Incoming Connection icon. When the Tivo
disconnects, that user disappears.</p>
<p>A word on port speeds: If you didn't use 115,200 as the
maximum port speed, you need to change the Tivo's prefix. ",#211"
assumes 115,200. The "11" part of that is the port speed. So if
you used 19,200, say, that should become ",#219". Or if you used
9600, that should be ",#296". The last two digits of the prefix
string are the same as the first two digits of the port speed you
use. It doesn't support anything higher than 115,200,
however.</p>


<hr>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>You don't get a connection to the XP box: Remove the incoming
connection you created and start HyperTerminal. Put it on the
correct serial port and start the Tivo's dial sequence again
(with the ",#211" prefix). If you see a bunch of garbage appear,
starting with a ~ character, then you're fine. Just as a check,
though, wait for it to spit out about 5-6 lines of garbage and
you should see the words "User Request" in that mess before the
Tivo's connection fails. If you do not see this text in the
garbage, you probably have the port speeds wrong somehow. if you
see nothing at all, you picked the wrong port or messed up the
cable connection somehow. It has to be a NULL modem cable. If you
have the cable that came with the Tivo (9-pin D-Shell to
miniplug) then get a 9 pin null modem adapter and a 9 pin
female->female gender bender.</p>
<p>Tivo seems to connect to the XP box, but doesn't finish
negotiating and doesn't get on the LAN (quick disconnect): You
didn't check "Always allow directly connected devices..." in the
incoming connections properties page.</p>
<p>It connects, but fails because it can't get anything from the
internet: Several possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>You didn't check "Allow callers access to the LAN" (assuming
you have a NAT box like a Linksys Cable/DSL Router or another box
somewhere doing NAT for your LAN->broadband connection)</li>
<li>You have no NAT box, and you are using an IP on the Tivo's
connection that isn't valid on the rest of the internet: use a
routing program like WinGate or WinRoute to route the packets
from the Tivo to the real world. Also, in this case, don't check
"Allow callers access to the LAN". You'll also need to use a
static IP on the Tivo's connection (instead of assigning address
via DHCP).</li>
<li>You don't have broadband, but dial in to the internet and
want the Tivo to use your PC's dial in connection: Again, WinGate
and WinRoute. You'll also need to use a static IP on the Tivo's
connection (instead of assigning address via DHCP).
<li>Something else: Hell if I know. Don't ask me, I am not
all-knowing. Consult someone who knows networks.</li>
</ul>
