  <h1>Creating Icon Packs For IconMgr With PilRC.</h1>

  <p>I should probably start with the disclaimer that the following
    instructions are for Windows only.  You can probably modify them
    to work under some sort of Unix, but I'm not going to, since I
    figure that if you're smart enough to run Unix, you're smart
    enough to figure this stuff out.</p>

  <p>So, here's my example code.  You'll need to download and install
    <a href="http://pilrc.sourceforge.net/">pilrc</a>.  (Check the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7404"
    >Downloads page</a>.)  I've chosen to put it in a
    <code>pilrc</code> subdirectory.  You'll also need some bitmaps.
    The small ones should be 10x9, and the large ones should be 20x18.
    If you have a program like Photoshop, you should convert your
    images to 8-bit colour, and use <a href="PalmOS.act">this colour
    table</a> so that Photoshop can handle all the dithering, instead
    of letting PilRC do it.  (PilRC does a fair job, but it's not
    going to be as good as a program which was designed to do exactly
    that.) I've got some sample images which you should download and
    save into an <code>images</code> subdirectory.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="images/AgentSmithSmallGrey.bmp"><img
    src="images/AgentSmithSmallGrey.bmp"/></a></li>
    <li><a href="images/AgentSmithSmallColour.bmp"><img
    src="images/AgentSmithSmallColour.bmp"/></a></li>
    <li><a href="images/AgentSmithLargeColour.bmp"><img
    src="images/AgentSmithLargeColour.bmp"/></a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Okay, so now we have our PilRC, and our images, and it's time to
    write the file that ties them all together.  Here's mine, which
    I've named <code>icons.rcp</code>, with some explanation
    afterwards.<p>

  <pre>/**
 * Icons.
 **/
BITMAPFAMILYEX ID 1
BEGIN
  BITMAP "images/AgentSmithSmallGrey.bmp" BPP 4    
  BITMAP "images/AgentSmithSmallColour.bmp" BPP 8   
  BITMAP "images/AgentSmithLargeColour.bmp" BPP 8 DENSITY 2
END</pre>

  <p>So, What's there to explain.  The first three lines are comments.
    The next 6 define a family of bitmaps.  Large bitmaps have to have
    <code>DENSITY 2</code> at the end.  <code>BPP 4</code> means that
    there are four bits of colour information per pixel, which in
    Palm-land means it's a greyscale image.  <code>BPP 8</code> means
    that there are 8 bits of colour information per pixel, which in
    Palm-land means that it's an indexed colour image.  If you wanted
    to add more images, you would repeat the whole
    <code>BITMAPFAMILYEX</code> block, with a different
    <code>ID</code>.  One thing to watch out for is ids that are
    greater than 10,000 or so.  They can interfere with some standard
    Palm bitmaps.  As long as you start your ids at 1, and work your
    way up, you shouldn't have any problems.</p>

  <p>The final piece of the puzzle is how to turn the images and the
    <code>icons.rcp</code> file into something that you can install on
    your Palm.  I've written a batch file, called
    <code>icons.bat</code> to automate much of the work for me.  And
    here it is.</p>

  <pre>pilrc\pilrc -ro -type Rsrc -creator Actn -name "New Icons" icons.rcp
copy /Y icons.ro icons.prc</pre>

  <p>Does it need any explanation?  I don't think so, but if you feel
    I'm wrong, please <a href="mailto:bwinton+iconmgr@latte.ca">email
    me</a>, and I'll throw some more information up here.</p>

  <p>Oh, I'll be adding more icons to the file as I convert them.  You
    can get a copy of the latest version <a
    href="Icons.prc">here</a>.  And I wanted to mention that the
    reason I'm doing this in the first place is to get people to think
    about the hi-res and lo-res icons differently.  There's no reason
    they have to be the same as each other.  When I create galleries
    of digital pictures on the web, I usually take an interesting
    snippet from the picture to use as a thumbnail.  The people who
    created the Ravenswood Manor icons which I'm using as a base for
    the rest of the icons in my pack had the same idea.  The lo-res
    icons are a close-up detail of part of the hi-res icons.  You can
    get a good idea of which icon it is from the lo-res, and see the
    full picture in the hi-res.  Personally, I'ld love to see more
    icon creators do things like this, but I realize that it takes a
    lot more time, and so it's unlikely to happen.</p>
