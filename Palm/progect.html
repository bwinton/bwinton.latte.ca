  <h1>Future Progect Developments.</h1>

  <p>
  Okay, so yes I am intending on doing some _large_ changes, and actually
  you are welcome to join me in doing it, I'm going to try and give you a
  brief synopsis of what I'm thinking.

  I want to break things up into 3 major layers (list viewer, adapter if
  required, and database (iterator)), because lots of stuff is duplicated,
  I'm in a hurry to describe it, and I've not completely done my groundwork
  yet but here goes, we may need to change any of this...

  The list display code is duplicated 3 or maybe 4 times (if you include
  flat mode categories). I would encapuslate the handling somehow, either
  in a C++ object, or the C equivalent.

  What I'm thinking is that we would have list display code that would call
  into an iterator to get it's values to display, the object returned would
  be responsble for drawing itself. The task database would be reformed
  into an iterator, as would my special database to handle project
  *categories* et al. Flat mode would be accomplished with an iterator
  *adapter* that would get plugged in between the database and the list
  viewer, the project list would simply be passed  an iterator for the
  project list database.  Categegories would simply be another iterator.

  In each case we would probably have to write a display object to display
  the data in the appropriate way, but no big deal really.

  You might think it's odd to show something hierachical with a list, but
  in fact that's the way it's done now, the task knows how to show itself
  in tree mode, we would simply run with that idea.

  I would start by writing the list viewer as an object say, and then
  convert the project list to see if it flew, then we would go after tree
  mode, then flat mode, then category list.

  I'm slightly hesitant to use C++ because I'm not sure how the [I presme
  there is one] 64k limit would interact with it, but then if we use C++,
  we would probably drop our code size by 25%, we are already well under
  64k (most of our size seems to be the compatibility library we link
  with).

  I also see us allowing *plugins* in the future, so that if you wanted a
  different *flat mode*, you would simply write the plugin and away we'd
  go, I'm also concerned about how C++ would affect that. But once we got
  it into C++, going backwards if we had to might not be that bad really.

  Editing would be handled by the display object in whatever way it had to.
  The class could either be reused, extended or whatever, but I don't
  expect that to happen except for low level routines because the screen
  display is so different in each case.

  [11:34] Coder: Yeah, I love that part of it.  And having things that know
  how to draw themselves.
  [11:37] Silicon Valley: Yea, I don't think we can do that exactly,
  although that would be nice, IE have the objects just do it when they
  need to, but I want to pass back objects that do indeed know how to draw
  themselves so the list viewer can just tell them to draw. We might even
  want to use a drawing wrapper on the object returned by the DB, should
  think about that, may increase code reuse.
  [11:37] Silicon Valley: Or make it a descendant, of the object or
  whatever...
  [11:38] Silicon Valley: I'm thinking of using interfaces rather than
  heirarchy per-se, so we can reuse more easily.

  [11:40] Coder: Did you want to continue supporting the memopad versions
  of icons?
  [11:41] Silicon Valley: I'm going to try and create the branch this
  afternoon, I'll tell you the new name, and then we can hack away in their
  to our heart's content until we have to actually release something.
  [11:41] Silicon Valley: No, well, I want to rip them out once we support
  DB5 icons. If someone really wants the old, maybe...
  [11:42] Coder: Cool.  I might see if I can get the new-format icons
  working in the old codebase, sort of as a proof of concept, and to help
  me get familiar with the code, and how it works.
  [11:42] Coder: (It seems like it wouldn't be that bad to maintain
  compatibility.  Basically, if you don't have new-style icons, we'll
  fall-back to old style.)
  [11:43] Silicon Valley: Okay, actually then, can I create a separate
  branch for the icons? I think that's better for two reasons, 1) They are
  separate ideas 2) We can roll your changes in sooner. I like to have one
  branch per idea, it keeps things simpler.
  [11:44] Coder: Sure.
  [11:44] Silicon Valley: If you want to continue to support the old icons,
  I'm okay with that, but remember most everyone will switch to the new
  ones and then we will have more code to support... Perhaps EOLife it,
  and rip it out the release after...
