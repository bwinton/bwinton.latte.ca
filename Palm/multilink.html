  <h1>C++ Shared Libraries With Multilink.</h1>

  <p>I've been working with Colin Lawrence getting shared
  libraries written in C++ using virtual functions in
  multiple code segments to function under <a
  href="http://www.djw.org/product/palm/multilink/index.html"
  >Multilink</a>.  I should probably state at this point
  that Multilink is a tool to link Palm programs into
  multiple code segments.  It is truly amazing, and I wish
  that the prc-tools people would incorporate the
  functionality into their product, since it makes many
  things possible which aren't by any other means.  Such
  things as C++ virtual methods in shared libraries,
  crossing multi segment boundries.  So, now that I've told
  you why you really need to use Multilink, let me tell you
  how to fix the bugs we've run across.  (Note:  If you have
  problems with Multilink, please <a
  href="mailto:bwinton@tor.dhs.org">let me know</a> and I'll
  try to post the solutions here.)</p>

  <ul title="Multilink Problems">
    <li><a href="#LockedRecords">Locked records in closed database</a></li>
    <li><a href="#CallingAcrossSegments">Calling across segments</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="LockedRecords">Locked</a> records in closed
    database</h2>
  <p>The most recent problem we ran into was a error from
  the emulator complaining about locked records in an closed
  database.  We had no idea what this could be, and after
  tracing the lock count through the use of the
  "<code>DmGetDatabaseLockState</code>" function, we
  discovered that the runtime function multilink inserts at
  the start of the code had a companion function "<code>void
  _shlib_end( void* globals );</code>" that needed to be
  called at the end of the code.  Unfortunately no-one was
  calling it.  So we tried calling it in our "<code>Err
  PalmShLibClose( UInt16 _refnum, UInt16 *_refCount)</code>"
  method, but that failed for some reason.</p>

  <p>A little later, I've found out why it failed.  The code
  in <code>_shlib_end</code> looks like the following:</p>

<pre>
void
_shlib_end(void* globals) /* entryP-&lt;globalsP */
{
    unsigned** jmptables;
    void* save_a4;
    void* save_a5;

    save_a4 = reg_a4;
    save_a5 = reg_a5;
    reg_a5 = globals;
    reg_a4 = globals;
    asm volatile ("sub.l #edata,%a4");
    globals = reg_a4;
    jmptables = MultilinkSegmentJmpTables;
    reg_a4 = save_a4;
    reg_a5 = save_a5;
    MultilinkUnloadCodeSegments(MULTILINK_APPL_ID, jmptables, MULTILINK_NJMPTABLES);
    MemPtrFree( globals );
}
</pre>

  <p>However, when it gets compiled, the line "<code>globals
  = reg_a4</code>" seems to get optimized out (probably
  because the compiler doesn't understand that the previous
  line (<code>asm volatile ("sub.l #edata,%a4");</code>)
  modifies the value of the <code>reg_a4</code> variable,
  and so the line would be a no-op.  Therefore, a little
  later, when we get to the line "<code>MemPtrFree(
  globals);</code>", we aren't using the right
  <code>globals</code>, and so we get a Fatal Exception.
  I've come up with a bad "fix" for this, by adding the line
  "<code>asm volatile ("move.l %a4,%d3");</code>" after the
  line "<code>asm volatile ("sub.l #edata,%a4");</code>", to
  get a full <code>_shlib_end</code> of:</p>

<pre>
void
_shlib_end(void* globals) /* entryP-&lt;globalsP */
{
    unsigned** jmptables;
    void* save_a4;
    void* save_a5;

    save_a4 = reg_a4;
    save_a5 = reg_a5;
    reg_a5 = globals;
    reg_a4 = globals;
    asm volatile ("sub.l #edata,%a4");
    asm volatile ("move.l %a4,%d3");
    globals = reg_a4;
    jmptables = MultilinkSegmentJmpTables;
    reg_a4 = save_a4;
    reg_a5 = save_a5;
    MultilinkUnloadCodeSegments(MULTILINK_APPL_ID, jmptables, MULTILINK_NJMPTABLES);
    MemPtrFree( globals );
}
</pre>

  <p>which seems to work.  A better fix would be to somehow
  declare the <code>reg_a4</code> and <code>reg_a5</code>
  variables as <code>volatile</code> or somethimg similar,
  so that they don't get optimized out.  I should probably
  mention at this point that the command I used to recompile
  the MultiLink library was "<code>m68k-palmos-gcc -c -Os
  -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -Wall -Werror
  -DMULTILINK_NEW_HEADERS -o
  ../lib/m68k-palmos-multilinkslcrt0.o
  shlibcrt0.o</code>".</p>

  <h2><a name="CallingAcrossSegments">Calling across
    segments</a></h2>
  <p>The problem that caused me to create this page was
  trying to call across segments from within a shared
  library.  The first call into the shared library worked
  just fine, as long as the first call was located in the
  first segment, but any calls outside of that segment
  failed miserably.  After a lot of tracking, we determined
  that it was because the globals, although being set up for
  us before our ShlibMain function, weren't being set up for
  us before any of our other entry points.  (To be fair,
  there's no place for Multilink to set them up, since the
  PalmOS just jumps straight into our code.) So we need to
  set them up ourselves.  The code to do that looks like
  this:</p>

<pre>
/**
 * Keep track of the application's a5 value.
 **/
extern MemPtr     app_a5;
register MemPtr   reg_a5 asm("%a5");

/**
 * Entry macro at the start start of all shared library entry points.
 **/
#define PALM_SHLIB_EP_INIT                                  \
    SysLibTblEntryPtr   entryP = SysLibTblEntry( _refnum ); \
    MemPtr              shlib_a5 = entryP-&gt;globalsP;        \
    MemPtr              temp_a5 = reg_a5;                   \
    reg_a5 = shlib_a5;                                      \
    app_a5 = temp_a5

/**
 * Exit macro at the end of all shared library entry
 * points.
 **/
#define PALM_SHLIB_EP_DEINIT                                \
    reg_a5 = temp_a5

/**
 * Entry macro at the start of all shared
 * library callbacks.
 **/
#define PALM_SHLIB_CB_INIT                                  \
    MemPtr          temp_a5 = reg_a5;                       \
    reg_a5 = app_a5

/**
 * Exit macro at the end of all shared
 * library callbacks.
 **/
#define PALM_SHLIB_CB_DEINIT                                \
    reg_a5 = temp_a5

#endif

Err MyShLibFunction( UInt16 refnum )
{
    PALM_SHLIB_EP_INIT;

    // put the body of the entry point here.

    PALM_SHLIB_EP_DEINIT;
}
</pre>

  <p> I recommend making macros to do those tasks, since
  they'll be the same for every entry point, and you'll need
  to call them for all your entry points.</p>

  <p>Now that I think about it a little more, I realize that
  this will mess you up if you try to call back to your
  application, so all of your application callbacks should
  probably go through another function that undoes the a5
  modification before calling back to your app.  This looks
  like it's going to get messy, but that's the price for
  living on the bleeding edge.</p>
