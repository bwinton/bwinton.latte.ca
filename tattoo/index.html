    <h2>Blake's Tattoo(s)</h2>
    <p>So, I've been thinking of getting a couple of tattoos for a few
    years now.  My main problem was deciding what to get.  I've gone
    through a lot of ideas, and waited for at least a month after each
    of them, and after that period, they started to sound kinda dumb.
    Until I thought of getting an armband in Hebrew.  I really liked
    the idea, so I waited for a couple of months, and I still really
    liked it.  In the meantime, <a
    href="http://tor.dhs.org/~arbrown/">my wife</a> got a tattoo on
    her ankle of a fish jumping over the sun.  (You can see a picture
    of it in &quot;Day Two&quot;), and I thought &quot;Wouldn't it be
    nice to get a matching tattoo...  But not exactly the same, just
    the same idea...&quot;, so Amy and I came up with the idea of a
    lion jumping over the planet Neptune (which I continually
    mispronounce as &quot;Uranus&quot;.  I try not to, but the pun is
    just too good).  The final impetus came from a wedding present Amy
    and I got from <a href="http://www.grammasbackdoor.com/">John R.
    MacMillan</a>; A pair of gift certificates for <a
    href="http://www.interlog.com/~passage/">Passage</a>, a body
    modification studio.  So, after a few months, I finally figured
    out what I wanted the tattoo to say, and so I made an appointment
    and went.  Just as a note to anyone thinking of getting a tattoo,
    They HURT!  A Lot!  I like mine, but I'm <em>really</em> hoping
    that everything heals nicely, because I'ld hate to have to go in
    for a touch-up on the planet...</p>
