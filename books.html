          I really enjoyed this book.  It seemed to be quite clever
          with it's playing around with the language it's written in.
          This could be really annoying in a less well-written book,
          but in this book it just amused me.  I'm not entirely sure
          how I managed to pick up and finish this book while I'm in
          the middle of reading two others, but I guess that's how
          these things work.

          This wasn't the sort of book I usually read (by which I mean
          Fantasy and Science Fiction, peppered with the occasional
          technical manual), but I did enjoy it.  There are a lot of
          subtexts that I wouldn't have picked up on reading it by
          myself, but after I read the comments from some smart people
          on the book, I could see where the author was drawing on
          several mythologies.  I'm not sure whether I would have
          enjoyed the book more or less if I was reading to find stuff
          like that, as opposed to just reading for the joy of the
          story, but this way, I seem to get the best of both worlds.

          I'm a sucker for books about super-intelligent children.
          Also for books where the protagonist is also the villain.
          So it should come as no surprise to hear that I enjoyed this
          book, for the most part.  There were a couple of places
          where I thought that someone as smart as the main character
          was portrayed wouldn't have made the obvious mistakes he
          did, and as a villain he does seem to act more scrupulously
          than most people I've met, but those are pretty much my main
          complaints, and they seem rather minor.  One thing I am
          still enjoying is the secret code that they have put at the
          bottom of each page.  It's not as hard to figure out as I
          had hoped, since the main character decodes it, and provides
          you with enough text to get a sample of almost every
          character, so translating the code is merely a matter of
          character substitution, but to be fair, the book is aimed at
          younger children, so they shouldn't make it too hard.
          Anyways, I've decided to ignore the section where the main
          character translates it, and work out the mapping on my own.

          As baby books go, this was one of the better ones I've read.
          It had all the information I would have expected, given the
          title, and was written in a light-hearted, fun style.  There
          were a couple of places in the book where the author
          denigrated the husband's role in the whole pregnancy thing
          which I found doubly annoying, being both a husband and
          someone who's deeply involved in the childbirth experience.
          Perhaps if more books said that men should be an equal (or
          almost equal) partner in the process, more men would take
          a larger part.  On the other hand, perhaps not.

          Well, this seemed to take forever to read.  In retrospect I
          guess it was less than a standard university term of four
          months, so I could be doing pretty well.  The hardest part
          of this book was deciding whether to do the sample exercises
          or not.  I settled on not after I spent a day and a half
          trying to get an answer to the first question.  (Part of the
          problem was getting a Scheme interpreter that would run on
          my Palm.  Part of the problem was figuring out the syntax of
          Scheme.  Part of the problem was hitting the limits of
          Scheme on a tiny, slow device.  And the final thing that
          convinced me was that it took me weeks to get through the
          first chapter, and if I was already going this slowly then
          surely slowing myself down even further was unnecessary.

	  I found this book very hard to start (Indeed, I first picked

          The sequal to <em>The Talisman</em> also started off slowly.
	  It takes the authors 100 pages before they introduce to the
	  main character.  Things move faster after that, and I was
	  successfully mislead at a number of places in the book as to
	  which characters were the good guys, and which characters
	  were acting on behalf of the forces of evil.  The ending
	  also caught me by surprise, even with the warnings.
